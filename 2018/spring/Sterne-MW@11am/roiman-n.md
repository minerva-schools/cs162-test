# markdown is scary
## really, been coding for a while, never understood it

it's not as easy as:
  '''python
  if 1==0:
  	print "end of days"
  else:
  	print "reality is ok"
  '''

I am a _lewis carroll_ fan, and __especially__ of his nonsense:

> "The time has come," the Walrus said,
> "To talk of many things:
> Of shoes--and ships--and sealing-wax--
> Of cabbages--and kings--
> And why the sea is boiling hot--
> And whether pigs have wings."

- I like to make lists
  - they're helpful for organizing things
  - and remaining productive
  - even for communicating
- Being right is often not good for you
