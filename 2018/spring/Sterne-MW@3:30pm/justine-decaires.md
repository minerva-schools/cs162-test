Lovingly hand-generated by [Sagan Ipsum](http://saganipsum.com/?p=1),
here's how a Markov chain using Carl Sagan's *Cosmos* as its source text would describe **Justine**:

>Another world hundreds of thousands, birth the carbon in our apple pies. A billion trillion. At the edge of forever? Cosmos with pretty stories for which there's little good evidence citizens of distant epochs rich in mystery preserve and cherish that pale blue dot the carbon in our apple pies laws of physics tesseract extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence are creatures of the cosmos Cambrian explosion network of wormholes ship of the imagination astonishment courage of our questions, hearts of the stars? Shores of the cosmic ocean made in the interiors of collapsing stars, cosmic fugue and billions upon billions upon billions upon billions upon billions upon billions upon billions.
