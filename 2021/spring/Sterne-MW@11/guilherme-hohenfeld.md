# Guilherme Hohenfeld

My name is _Guilherme Hohenfeld_ but everyone calls me **Hohen**. The thing is that I went to military school back in *Brazil* and there, we needed to choose a name to be known as, a **war name**. I made the choice to be called *Hohenfeld*, my last name; therefore, my friends chose **Hohen** to be my nickname and people call me like this for over _**10 years**_.

There are many things I like to do, such as:
* Read books
    * My favorite book is called *Dragões de Éter* or Dragons of Ether (rough translation)
* Watch TV shows and movies
    * My favorite movie (**or trilogy**) is **The Lord of the Rings** and favorite TV show is **Breaking Bad**
* Creating lists

Now, I study at **Minerva Schools at KGI** Majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Psychology. I will write a capstone based on Conversation design and empathy based on this TEDx speech: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6eNSf4br5Y&t=399s
